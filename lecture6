[[]] vs [] - two brackets is not the element, it's the thing inside the element 
- in R, we always have an array of strings (even if you have 1 thing, its an array with 1 thing inside of it)
- list is an array of boxes 

cat vs. print - print function automaitcally tries to format the output in a way that is related to the data types/structure of R code 

unique_vals <- values%>%table() 
- table shows us what the values are in an array and how many of them there are 

\n = new line 
\r\n = carriage return 

df %>% group_by(state) %>% tally() %>% arrange(n)
