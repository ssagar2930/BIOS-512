CLUSTERING 
- more extreme act of summmarization than dimensionality reduction. we have a set of numbers, and instead of saying we 
can describe its dimensions, we can reduce the structure down past any structure with a topology and into a simple set 

K-MEANS 
- start with some points living in space 
- want to automatically sort each point into a given cluster 

Step 1: random assignment of labels 
Step 2: Calculate center of each cluster (centroids). Going to treat cluster center as official information. 
Step 3 + iterate: reassign labels, recompute means
