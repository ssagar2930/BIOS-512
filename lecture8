git is always telling you exactly what's going on 

git diff
- if i added everything, what would the stage look like 
- shows you most recently changed lines of code and then you can get a sense of what is going on 
- diff is a tool, calculates a patch. patches are chunks 

git hub holy trinity: the tree, the stage, the head 

unless you specifically say so, you are working locally. just sending each other patches 

git status : print info about the trinity
git add : move a change from the TREE to the STAGE
git diff : show the difference between the HEAD and the TREE (sans the STAGE)
git commit : move the STAGE into the HEAD
git checkout <something> : move something from the HEAD to the TREE
