principles of effective visualization: 
1. diagram first 
- look for weird things, look for repeats 

2. use the right software 
- 2 kinds of visualization situations 
- looking for something that has the rlight abstraction, right level of interpretation 
- doomed to have the wrong abstraction because the wrong abstraction is the simplest one 
- ggplot: good for static visualizations where you aren't changing anything (non-interactive visualizations) 

3. using an effective geometry 
- when plotting data as a line, drawing people to values -- filling in values. values in between two points mean nothing unless they DO mean something
- bar chart shows contrast more clearly - easier for our brains to compare 
- bar chart has a single number that shows a summary of a group of poeople. summaries simplify our data.

4. color always means something 
- be mindful of people are colorblind

5. facets
- faceted

6. data and models are differen things 
- every visualization is a model that compresses data to a set amount of salient features
